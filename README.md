## Sponsorship

While **ERPSAAS** is open-source, maintaining it requires significant time and resources. Your sponsorship directly
supports ongoing development, bug fixes, and improved documentation.

As a solo developer, I can only provide limited free support. Sponsors receive priority assistance, input on feature
priorities, and early access to updates. Even a small monthly contribution makes a significant difference in keeping
this project actively maintained.

**Become a sponsor:** [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/andrewdwallo)

# Getting started

## Installation

Please check the official laravel installation guide for server requirements before you
start. [Official Documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x)

Clone the repository

    git clone https://github.com/andrewdwallo/erpsaas.git

Switch to the repo folder

    cd erpsaas

Install all the dependencies using composer and npm

    composer install
    npm install

Copy the example env file and make the required configuration changes in the .env file

    cp .env.example .env

Generate a new application key

    php artisan key:generate

Run the database migrations (**Set the database connection in .env before migrating**)

    php artisan migrate

Build your assets & start the local development server

    php artisan filament:assets
    npm run build
    npm run dev

**Command list**

    git clone https://github.com/andrewdwallo/erpsaas.git
    cd erpsaas
    composer install
    npm install
    cp .env.example .env
    php artisan key:generate
    php artisan migrate
    npm run build
    npm run dev

## Database seeding

**You may populate the database to help you get started quickly**

Open the DatabaseSeeder and set the property values as per your requirement

    database/seeders/DatabaseSeeder.php

Default login information:

    email: admin@erpsaas.com
    password: password

Run the database seeder

    php artisan db:seed

***Note***: It's recommended to have a clean database before seeding. You can reset your database to a clean state at
any point by running the following command:

    php artisan migrate:fresh

## Generating PDFs for Reports

To generate PDFs for reports, the application uses Laravel Snappy. The Laravel Snappy package is already included in the
application, but you need to install Wkhtmltopdf separately.

### Wkhtmltopdf Installation

1. **Download and install Wkhtmltopdf**
    - [Wkhtmltopdf Downloads](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html)

    - Alternatively, if you are using Homebrew on macOS, you can install it using the following command:
      ```bash
      brew install wkhtmltopdf
      ```

2. **Configure the binary paths**
    - If needed, you can change the paths to the Wkhtmltopdf binaries in the Snappy configuration file (
      `config/snappy.php`).

For detailed installation instructions, refer to
the [Laravel Snappy documentation](https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-snappy).

## Live Currency

### Overview

This application offers support for real-time currency exchange rates. This feature is disabled by default. To enable
it, you must first register for an API key at [ExchangeRate-API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/). The application
uses this service due to its generous provision of up to 1,500 free API calls per month, which should be enough for
development and testing purposes.

**Disclaimer**: There is no affiliation between this application and ExchangeRate-API.

Once you have your API key, you can enable the feature by setting the `CURRENCY_API_KEY` environment variable in your
`.env` file.

### Initial Setup

After setting your API key in the `.env` file, it is essential to prepare your database to store the currency data.
Start by running a fresh database migration:

```bash
php artisan migrate:fresh
```

This ensures that your database is in the correct state to store the currency information. Afterward, use the following
command to generate and populate the Currency List with supported currencies for the Live Currency page:

```bash
php artisan currency:init
```

This command fetches and stores the list of currencies supported by your configured exchange rate service.

### Configuration

Of course, you may use any service you wish to retrieve currency exchange rates. If you decide to use a different
service, you can update the `config/services.php` file with your choice:

```php
'currency_api' => [
    'key' => env('CURRENCY_API_KEY'),
    'base_url' => 'https://v6.exchangerate-api.com/v6',
],
```

Then, adjust the implementation of the `App\Services\CurrencyService` class to use your chosen service.

### Live Currency Page

Once enabled, the "Live Currency" feature provides access to a dedicated page in the application, listing all supported
currencies from the configured exchange rate service. Users can view available currencies and update exchange rates for
their company's currencies as needed.

### Important Information

- To use the currency exchange rate feature, you must first obtain an API key from a service provider. This application
  is configured to use a service that offers a free tier suitable for development and testing purposes.
- Your API key is sensitive information and should be kept secret. Do not commit it to your repository or share it with
  anyone.
- Note that API rate limits may apply depending on the service you choose. Make sure to review the terms for your chosen
  service.

## Automatic Translation

The application now supports automatic translation, leveraging machine translation services provided by AWS, as
facilitated by the [andrewdwallo/transmatic](https://github.com/andrewdwallo/transmatic) package. This integration
significantly enhances the application's accessibility for a global audience. The application currently offers support
for several languages, including English, Arabic, German, Spanish, French, Indonesian, Italian, Dutch, Portuguese,
Turkish, and Chinese, with English as the default language.

### Configuration & Usage

To utilize this feature for additional languages or custom translations:

1. Follow the documentation provided in the [andrewdwallo/transmatic](https://github.com/andrewdwallo/transmatic)
   package.
2. Configure the package with your preferred translation service credentials.
3. Run the translation commands as per the package instructions to generate new translations.

Once you have configured the package, you may update the following method in the `app/Models/Setting/Localization.php`
file to generate translations based on the selected language in the application UI:

Change to the following:

```php
public static function getAllLanguages(): array
{
    return Languages::getNames(app()->getLocale());
}
```

## Plaid Integration

To integrate [Plaid](https://plaid.com/) with your application for enhanced financial data connectivity, you must first
create an account with Plaid and obtain your credentials. Set your credentials in the `.env` file as follows:

```env
PLAID_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
PLAID_CLIENT_SECRET=your-secret
PLAID_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox # Can be sandbox, development, or production
PLAID_WEBHOOK_URL=https://my-static-domain.ngrok-free.app/api/plaid/webhook # Must have /api/plaid/webhook appended
```

The `PLAID_WEBHOOK_URL` is essential as it enables your application to receive real-time updates on transactions from
connected bank accounts. This webhook URL must contain a static domain, which can be obtained from services like ngrok
that offer a free static domain upon signup. Alternatively, you may use any other service that provides a static domain.

After integrating Plaid, you can connect your account on the "Connected Accounts" page and link your financial
institution. Before importing transactions, ensure to run the following command to process the queued transactions:

```bash
php artisan queue:listen
```

## Testing

This project includes testing using [Pest](https://pestphp.com/). The current
test suite covers some reporting features and other core functionality. While it's not yet a fully comprehensive test
suite, it provides a foundation for testing critical features.

### Setting Up the Testing Environment

#### Create a testing database

Ensure that you create a separate testing database named `erpsaas_test` in your database management system (e.g.,
MySQL).

```bash
CREATE DATABASE erpsaas_test;
```

### Running Tests

The testing process automatically handles refreshing and seeding the test database with each test run, so no manual
migration is required. For more information on how to write and run tests using
Pest, refer to the official documentation: [Pest Documentation](https://pestphp.com/docs).
